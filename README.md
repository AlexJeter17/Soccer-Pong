# Soccer-Pong
2 Player soccer game, based off Pong

This is a game I made along 2 other of my classmates(THey do not have github), during my attendance at Google CSSI(Computer Science Summer Institute). This game is a 2 player game that includes an mp3 file of crowds cheering, while one of the players uses the Arrow Keys and the other uses WASD keys. The code used was JavaScript with the main classes being called throughout the program as well as many If-Else statements for ball movement and player movement. The key library utilized was p5. 

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

Hope you enjoy! :)
